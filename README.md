# Decryptor
It is a script that decrypts numeric messages, encrypted with arrays. Just replace the "mensagemEncriptada" field with your message and the "matrizOriginal" field with the one you used to encrypt. If you have the node installed just run the command "node ." and the terminal will return the decoded message. If you don't have, just install the Gitpod extension and execute the same command in gitpod interface.
